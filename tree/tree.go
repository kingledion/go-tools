/*
Package tree implements a simple tree that can be serialized and deserialized
from a byte-based storage, such as a file or cloud storage.

A tree is here defined as a graph having three properties:
  - a single root node with no inbound edges
  - all non-root nodes have exactly one inbound edge (parent)
  - any node may have any number of outbound edges (children)
The nodes of the tree are assumed to have a primary identifier or key by
which parent and child relationships can be defined.

The implemented tree data structure consists of a pointer to the root node
and an index allowing fast lookup of nodes by their primary key. Each node
holds the primary key of itself and its parent, as well as a pointer to its
parent and an array of pointers to its children. All nodes also store an
arbitrary set of node data, which can be any structure. Children of a node are
not ordered, and therefore are traversed in an order determined by the order
in which they are added to the tree.

This package includes tree traversal algorithms for breadth-first and depth-
first search.
